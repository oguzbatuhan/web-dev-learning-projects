        <h3>ü¶â General Description:</h3>
        <p>
          The Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) is a large, iconic owl species native
          to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is famous for
          its stunning white plumage, which provides excellent camouflage in
          snowy environments. Unlike many other owls, Snowy Owls are diurnal,
          meaning they are active during the day as well as night.
        </p>

        <h3>üìè Physical Characteristics:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Length: 52‚Äì71 cm</li>
          <li>Wingspan: 125‚Äì150 cm</li>
          <li>Weight: 1.6‚Äì3 kg</li>
          <li>
            Plumage: Primarily white with variable amounts of dark barring or
            spots; males tend to be whiter than females.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eyes: Bright yellow with black rims, providing sharp vision in
            bright Arctic light.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>üåç Distribution and Habitat:</h3>
        <p>
          Snowy Owls breed in the Arctic tundra, nesting on open ground. During
          winter, they migrate southward and can be found in open fields,
          prairies, and coastal areas across Canada, the northern United States,
          Europe, and parts of Asia. They prefer vast, treeless landscapes where
          they hunt and nest.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>üõñ Behavior and Lifestyle:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unlike most owls, Snowy Owls are diurnal or active during daylight
            hours, especially in Arctic summers when there is 24-hour daylight.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are territorial and often solitary outside the breeding season.
          </li>
          <li>
            Well adapted to cold climates with thick plumage and feathered feet
            for insulation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>üçΩÔ∏è Diet:</h3>
        <p>
          Primarily feed on small mammals, especially lemmings, which form the
          bulk of their diet in the Arctic. They also hunt birds such as ducks
          and shorebirds during winter months when they migrate south.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>üê£ Reproduction:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Breeding occurs in the Arctic summer.</li>
          <li>
            Nests are simple scrapes on the ground, often lined with feathers
            and plant material.
          </li>
          <li>Females lay 3‚Äì11 eggs depending on food availability.</li>
          <li>
            Incubation lasts about 32 days; chicks fledge around 50 days old.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Conservation Status:</h3>
        <p>
          Listed as ‚ÄúLeast Concern‚Äù by the IUCN, but populations can fluctuate
          dramatically with prey abundance, especially lemming cycles. Climate
          change poses a significant threat by altering Arctic habitats and prey
          availability.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>üåü Interesting Facts:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Snowy Owls can survive extreme cold temperatures due to their dense
            plumage and feathered legs.
          </li>
          <li>They have a powerful, silent flight despite their large size.</li>
          <li>
            Occasionally, ‚Äúirruptions‚Äù occur where large numbers migrate far
            south, sometimes as far as the southern United States or Europe,
            attracting birdwatchers worldwide.

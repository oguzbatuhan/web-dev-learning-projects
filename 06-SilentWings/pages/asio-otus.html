        <b>ü¶â General Overview:</b>
        <p>
          The Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) is a medium-sized nocturnal bird of
          prey known for its long, upright ear tufts, which give the species its
          name. These tufts are not actually ears, but feather structures used
          for camouflage and communication. The true ears are asymmetrically
          placed on the head to help pinpoint the exact location of
          sounds‚Äîespecially helpful when hunting in the dark.

        <h3>üåç Distribution and Habitat:</h3>
        <p>
          Long-eared Owls are widespread across Europe, Asia, and parts of North
          Africa. In Turkey and many parts of Europe, they are commonly found in
          coniferous or mixed forests, often near open fields or meadows where
          prey is abundant. They prefer dense trees for roosting and more open
          areas for hunting.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>üõñ Behavior:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Nocturnal: Active at night; rests during the day in thick
            vegetation.
          </li>
          <li>Solitary: Usually alone or in pairs during breeding season.</li>
          <li>
            Communal Roosting: In winter, they sometimes gather in large numbers
            (up to 20+ individuals) in a single tree to conserve warmth and for
            protection.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>üçΩÔ∏è Diet:</h3>
        <p>
          Primarily feeds on small mammals, especially voles and field mice.
          Occasionally eats small birds, amphibians, and large insects. It uses
          silent flight to sneak up on its prey and strike with precision.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>üê£ Reproduction:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Breeding season: Spring (March‚ÄìApril).</li>
          <li>Uses old nests of crows or hawks instead of building its own.</li>
          <li>Lays 4‚Äì6 eggs; incubation lasts around 25‚Äì30 days.</li>
          <li>
            Young owlets fledge within a few weeks but stay dependent on parents
            for a while.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Conservation Status:</h3>
        <p>
          Classified as "Least Concern (LC)" on the IUCN Red List. Though not
          currently endangered, the species is sensitive to habitat loss, use of
          pesticides, and human disturbance. In many countries, including
          Turkey, it is protected by law and should not be disturbed in the
          wild.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>üåü Fun Fact:</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike most owls, Long-eared Owls are known for their communal winter
          roosts. It's not uncommon to find multiple individuals roosting
          silently in a single tree during cold months‚Äîa fascinating and rare
          sight in the owl world!

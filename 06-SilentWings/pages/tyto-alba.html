        <ul>
          <li>Scientific Name: Tyto alba</li>
          <li>Common Name: Barn Owl</li>
          <li>Family: Tytonidae</li>

        <h3>🦉 General Description:</h3>
        <p>
          The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is a widely distributed and easily
          recognizable owl species known for its distinctive heart-shaped facial
          disc. It is renowned for its silent flight and exceptional hunting
          skills at night. Unlike many owls with rounded faces, the Barn Owl’s
          unique face shape helps it funnel sound to its ears for pinpointing
          prey in total darkness.

          <li>Wingspan: 80–95 cm</li>
          <li>Weight: 300–600 grams</li>
          <li>
            Plumage: Pale golden-buff upperparts with white or light underparts.
            The heart-shaped face is white with dark eyes.

          <li>Eyes: Dark and large, adapted for excellent night vision.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>🌍 Distribution and Habitat:</h3>
        <p>
          Barn Owls have a nearly global distribution, found on every continent
          except Antarctica. They inhabit a wide range of environments including
          farmland, grasslands, open woodlands, and urban areas. They often nest
          in barns, old buildings, tree cavities, and cliff ledges.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>🛖 Behavior and Lifestyle:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Primarily nocturnal, though they can sometimes be active at dusk or
            dawn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Known for their silent flight, thanks to specialized feather
            structures that muffle sound.
          </li>
          <li>
            Highly territorial, with pairs defending nesting and hunting
            territories year-round.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>🍽️ Diet:</h3>
        <p>
          Barn Owls mainly feed on small mammals such as rodents (mice, voles,
          rats). They use acute hearing to locate prey under grass or snow and
          swoop down silently to capture it with sharp talons.
        </p>

        <h3>🐣 Reproduction:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Breeding seasons vary by location but often occur in spring.</li>
          <li>Nests in cavities, buildings, or nest boxes.</li>
          <li>Females lay 4–7 eggs on a bare surface.</li>
          <li>
            Incubation lasts about 30 days; chicks fledge around 8–10 weeks old.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>🛡️ Conservation Status:</h3>
        <p>
          Classified as “Least Concern” by the IUCN globally. However, local
          populations can be vulnerable to habitat loss, pesticide use, and
          collisions with vehicles. Conservation efforts include installing nest
          boxes and protecting natural habitats.

        <h3>🌟 Interesting Facts:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Barn Owl’s face acts like a satellite dish to collect sound,
            giving it extraordinary hearing accuracy.
          </li>
          <li>
            They swallow their prey whole and later regurgitate pellets
            containing bones and fur.
          </li>
          <li>
            In many cultures, Barn Owls are symbols of mystery, wisdom, and
            sometimes superstition.

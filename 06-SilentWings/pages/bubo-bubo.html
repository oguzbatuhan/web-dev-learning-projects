        <hr />
        <h3>🌍 Distribution and Habitat:</h3>
        <p>
          The Eurasian Eagle-Owl is widespread across Europe, large parts of
          Asia, and North Africa. In Turkey, it is commonly found in protected
          and remote areas. It prefers rocky cliffs, mountainous forests,
          expansive woodlands, and open valleys.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>🛖 Behavior and Lifestyle:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Strictly nocturnal, hunting silently and powerfully during the
            night.
          </li>
          <li>Typically solitary, occupying large territories for hunting.</li>
          <li>Adapted to harsh weather and remains active even in winter.</li>
          <li>
            Possesses strong talons and a powerful beak, allowing it to capture
            and subdue large prey.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>🍽️ Diet:</h3>
        <p>
          Feeds on a wide variety of mammals (such as rabbits, squirrels, and
          rodents), birds, and occasionally amphibians. Its powerful hunting
          skills enable it to take down prey larger than itself and consume it
          whole or in parts.
        </p>

        <h3>🐣 Reproduction:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Breeding season generally occurs in late winter to early spring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Does not build its own nest; uses rocky ledges, abandoned nests of
            large birds, or tree cavities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The female lays 2–4 eggs, with an incubation period of about 28–36
            days.
          </li>
          <li>Chicks fledge approximately 6–7 weeks after hatching.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>🛡️ Conservation Status:</h3>
        <p>
          Classified as “Least Concern” by the IUCN. However, habitat loss,
          illegal hunting, and human disturbance pose threats to local
          populations. The Eurasian Eagle-Owl is legally protected in Turkey and
          many other countries.

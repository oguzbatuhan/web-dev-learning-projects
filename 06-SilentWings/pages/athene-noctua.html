        <h3>ü¶â Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          The Little Owl (Athene noctua) is a small, charismatic owl species
          widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is easily
          recognizable by its compact size, flat-topped head, bright yellow
          eyes, and fierce, expressive face. Despite its small stature, the
          Little Owl is bold and often seen perched in open areas during the
          day.
